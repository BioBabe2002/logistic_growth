# logistic_growth
R scripts for a reproducible analysis of logistic growth

10 points) Annotate the README.md file in your logistic_growth repo with more detailed information about the analysis. Add a section on the results and include the estimates for ,  and  (mention which *.csv file you used).

(10 points) Use your estimates of  and  to calculate the population size at  = 4980 min, assuming that the population grows exponentially. How does it compare to the population size predicted under logistic growth?

(20 points) Add an R script to your repository that makes a graph comparing the exponential and logistic growth curves (using the same parameter estimates you found). Upload this graph to your repo and include it in the README.md file so it can be viewed in the repo homepage.
